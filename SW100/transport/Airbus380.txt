The Airbus A380 (also called "Super-jumbo-jet") is a four-engined, double-decked airplane manufactured by Airbus. It is the world's biggest passenger airplane; larger than the Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. However, it is not the biggest airplane in the world; the Antonov An-225 super-freighter is the biggest in the world.

The Airbus A380 can carry up to 850 passengers (but it usually carries about 525), and weighs over 550 tonnes. It has four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines or four Engine Alliance GP7000 engines. The companies General Electric and Pratt & Whitney make alliance engines.

Orders

A total of 259 A380-800 airplanes have been ordered by 20 airlines. One has been ordered by a Saudi Arabian Prince, Al-Walid bin Talal and 10 by a company called ILFC (who gives other airlines airplanes for rent).

Emirates Airlines (an airline from the United Arab Emirates) will have the most A380 aircraft, because they have ordered 140 aircraft, and now they have 42. Singapore Airlines took delivery of the first A380, which flew to Sydney in Australia on October 25, 2007. Singapore Airlines now have 19 A380s and are still waiting for 5 more.

Other airlines whom have ordered the A380 are Qantas (from Australia, currently operating 7), Air France (who have four), China Southern Airlines, Lufthansa (from Germany, who have four), Kingfisher Airlines (from India), Korean Air (from South Korea), Thai Airways, Malaysia Airlines, British Airways, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways (from the United Arab Emirates), Virgin Atlantic (from the United Kingdom) and Air Austral (France).

Freighter Version

Airbus was going to make a version of the A380 which carried lots of cargo instead of lots of people. This would look almost the same as the normal passenger version, but it would have no windows and much bigger doors. Some cargo companies ordered the plane, like FedEx and UPS, But, because Airbus took too long to make the A380, orders for the plane have been cancelled. Because Airbus has not got any orders for the plane anymore, they decided to not make the freighter version for a while and focus on making the passenger version of the A380.

Incidents

The Airbus A380 had 1 incident, with no deaths.

On 4 November 2010, Qantas Flight 32 was flying from Singapore Changi Airport when the number 2 engine failed, causing some damage to the plane, and forcing it to return to Singapore. Nobody was injured, but debris from the airplane fell onto the island of Batam, in Indonesia. Investigations found that the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine leaked oil, causing an explosion. The Trent 900 engines were also affected, and many engines had to be changed.
