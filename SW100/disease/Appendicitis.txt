Appendicitis is the swelling of the appendix. The appendix is a pouch that is at the beginning of the large intestine. The causes include blocking in the appendix, sores, or bacterial infections. The bacteria will multiply, and Pus will fill the appendix. Symptoms include fever, a high white blood cell count, fast heart rate, and/or loss of appetite. The appendix also may rupture (burst). This would cause bacteria to travel through your body. This also may cause infection in other body parts. This happens if appendicitis is not treated. If it is not treated, it may lead to peritonitis and shock. More serious effects of appendicitis take place in younger children and elder adults. Appendicitis is common between the ages of ten and fourteen for males, and fifteen and nineteen for females. People should get an appendectomy which means someone removes the appendix. Sometimes, it will get better without surgery. Appendicitis cannot be avoided. However, some people think that eating vegetables will help. Reginald Fitz first described acute appendicitis in 1886. It is one of the leading causes worldwide of pain in the abdomen.
