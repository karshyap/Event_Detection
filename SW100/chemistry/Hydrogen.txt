Hydrogen is a chemical element. Its atomic number is 1, which makes it the simplest known element in the entire universe. Hydrogen is the true primordial substance, the first atom produced after the Big Bang. All chemical elements were formed from hydrogen by the processes of nuclear fusion.

Hydrogen glows purple when it is in plasma state.

Hydrogen in nature

In its pure form on Earth, hydrogen is usually a gas. Hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a water molecule. Hydrogen is important because it is the fuel that powers the Sun and other stars. Hydrogen makes up about 74% of the entire universe. Hydrogen's symbol on the Periodic Table of Elements is H.

Pure hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen atoms connected together. Scientists call these diatomic molecules. Hydrogen will have a chemical reaction when mixed with most other elements. It has no color or smell.

Pure hydrogen is very uncommon in the Earth's atmosphere. In nature, it is usually in water. Hydrogen is also in all living things, as a part of the organic compounds that living things are made of. In addition, hydrogen atoms can combine with carbon atoms to form hydrocarbons. Petroleum and other fossil fuels are made of these hydrocarbons and commonly used to create energy for human use.

Hydrogen has two different isotopes, called deuterium and tritium. Like regular hydrogen, they both have only one proton and one electron, but deuterium also has one neutron and tritium has two. These other types of hydrogen are important in nuclear energy and organic chemistry reactions.

Some other facts about hydrogen:

It is a gas at room temperature
It acts like a metal when it is solid.
It is the lightest element in the Universe.
It is the most common element in the Universe.
It burns or explodes when it touches a flame.
