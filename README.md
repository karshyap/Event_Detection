Open Domain Event Detection

This repository provides a dataset used in our [COLING 2018
paper](http://junaraki.net/pubs/coling2018-event.pdf) titled ``Open-Domain
Event Detection using Distant Supervision``.  The dataset comprises 100 Simple
English Wikipedia articles in 10 different domains, annotated with events.  We
call the dataset SW100.  They also provide our code for the rule-based event
detection system (RULE) described in the paper.
